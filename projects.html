            <p class="about-me">
                I have done my bachelors in Computer Science and 
                worked as a Software Developer for Capgemini for around 2 years.
                I have good experience in Java and I have worked on two different projects during my time in Capgemini. 
                I wanted to learn more about data handling, data analytics and visualization so I chose Data Science as my minor now.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>I have worked on many different projects during my entire academic career. 
            The most recent one is Food Truck Locator, which I have worked on during last semester.
            It is a web-based platform for finding the food trucks around us that are moving everyday. 
            This application can be used by food trucks to indicate their everyday location and by customers 
            to track which food trucks are nearby and get their daily updated location. The frontend was developed 
            using React and external modules, while backend is implemented using Rest APIs with Spring and MySQL to 
            store the data.

        <h2>Passion</h2>
        <p>
            Apart from this, I'm passionate about travelling. I just love going to different beaches. Here are a couple of shots from my recent travel:
