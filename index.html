            <p>Hiii!! This is Yashaswini, currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science here at UNCC. 
                I am from India. I have completed my bachelors in India and worked there for around 2 years. 
                In my free time, I'm passionate about traveling, cooking, painting. 
                I am currently in my last semester now and will graduate this December.
                I am having a great time here at UNCC and 
                I wish to make many more memories here.
            </p>
